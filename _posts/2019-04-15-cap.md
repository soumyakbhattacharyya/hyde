#### Basic Concept

- CAP theorem states that, it is impossible to build an implementation of read-write storage in an asynchronous network that satisfies all three factors of consistency, availability and partition tolerance at the same point in time, in case of a distributed system

  - Consistency - every read gets most recent write or an error... the question we ask here is *will all executions of reads and writes seen by all nodes be atomic or linearizably consistent*

    - Atomic or linearzable consistency

      - B:set(5), A:set(10), A:get() = 10, B:get() = 10
      - Atomic consistency ensures that external communication about the value of a register is respected. That is, if I read X and tell you about it, you can go to the register and read X for yourself. Therefore following situation depicts a case where though by the serial history *shows* as if the atomic consistency is assured, in reality it is not
        - What is not
          - B:set(5), B:get() = 5, A:set(10), A:get() = 10
  - Availability - every request receives a response, without the guarantee of it being the latest... the question we ask here is *will a request made to the data store always eventually complete?*

  - Partition Tolerance - the system continues to operate despite of network partitions (caused out of network failures)

  - Note
    - A read write storage is a register which supports following 2 operations
      - set(X) sets the value of the register to X
      - get() returns the last value set in the register
    - An asynchronous network is which has no bound on how long a message will take time to get delivered to the destination
    - Availability - a data store is called available if ALL requests return a response and not an error message
    - Partition - a partition is when a network fails to deliver messages to one or more nodes by completely loosing them 

- In real world scenario, because network fails all the time, it is impossible to a distributed system which guarantees C & A

- CP - in a consistent and partition tolerant system, requests may get responses or an error (because of the partition effect)

- AP - in an available and partition tolerant system, requests may get stale data and writes may require some time to get across all nodes (and the nodes are said to become eventually consistent)

- **History**

  - Dr. Eric Brewer gave a keynote speech at the Principles of Distributed Computing conference in 2000 called 'Towards Robust Distributed Systems'. In it he posed his 'CAP Theorem' - at the time unproven - which illustrated the tensions between being correct and being always available in distributed systems.
  - Two years later, Seth Gilbert and Professor Nancy Lynch - researchers in distributed systems at MIT - formalised and proved the conjecture in their paper “Brewer's conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services”
